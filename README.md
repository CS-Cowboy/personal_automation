# personal_automation
A Python 3.11 calculator utility for reading pdf financial statements and displaying itemized and cumulative tips and reimbursements from my current employer. Reason being my bank does not provide this by default. Also includes a generator for creating pdfs with generated tips and fuel reimbursements for testing (and demonstration) purposes. 'earnings_calulator.py' requires the python package 'pypdf2' while the 'example_earnings_generator.py' required the reportlab package.
